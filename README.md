# FaceByte Social Mapping Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the FaceByte Social Mapping Project! I'm excited to share my personal project where I'm tackling an interesting challenge related to social networking and user connections. In this project, I'm building a social mapping system for FaceByte, a social networking app that I'm passionate about.

## The Back Story
At FaceByte, we're committed to enhancing user experiences, and one crucial aspect is connecting users with their friends efficiently. My journey started with a simple idea â€“ what if I could create a system that finds the shortest path between two users within the app? This could power features like "find friends" and "suggested friends" and make the user experience even more engaging.

## The Task at Hand
My mission is clear: I need to develop a mapping/routing system that can find the shortest path between two users based on specific metrics. To achieve this, I've decided to implement three algorithms: Breadth-first Search (BFS), Depth-first Search (DFS), and the A* algorithm. These algorithms will help in discovering connections between users and optimizing the social networking experience.

## Project Highlights
- **BFS and DFS for Finding Friends**: These algorithms will be used to help users find their friends by tracing a path between them, revealing intermediate connections. It's all about efficiency and simplicity.

- **A* for Suggested Friends**: FaceByte wants to experiment with suggesting friends that diversify connections. A* will help us find paths with the least total similarity points, enriching the user experience.

## Maps, Metrics, and Challenges
To make this project a reality, I'll be working with maps that define the relationships between users. Some maps are based on similarity points, while others are distance-based. Handling loops and ensuring robustness are essential aspects of this challenge.

## Implementation
In my `student_code.py`, I'll be implementing these algorithms to return a list of user nodes representing the path from the start user to the end user. The code is designed to work smoothly with Python 3.x, and I'm aiming for compatibility with Python 3.9 and above.

## Contributing
While this project initially started as a personal endeavor, I welcome contributions and suggestions. If you have ideas to enhance the social mapping system or spot any improvements, feel free to contribute. Let's make FaceByte's social networking experience even better together!
